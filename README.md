Tomato disease classification using Convolutional Neural network in which we can save and know which tomato plants are suffering from disease like Late blight, Leaf Mold,Tomato septoria leaf spot etc so that famers donâ€™t suffer and take precaution beforehand. In this project I have taken Plant Village dataset having 16011 files and 10 classes and built a CNN model and got accuracy of 96.92% and at last built a website using React and which one can drag or simple upload image of leaf and the model will predict which disease it has and at what confidence level.
